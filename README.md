# Neural-Network-Based-Approach-for-Predicting-Obesity-Risk
# RESEARCH ABSTRACT
Obesity can be defined as a medical condition associated with the excess accumulation of fat, and it has  
been reported to be a major cause of mortality & morbidity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Early  
detection of obesity is of utmost importance to mitigate the long-term health challenges associated with this  
disease, necessitating the development of accurate and reliable diagnostic models. This study's primary  
focus is to develop a neural network model with the capacity of predicting patientsâ€™ obesity status with high  
precision and accuracy. The study used a public dataset sourced from the Kaggle database; it comprises  
2,111 patient records with 16 input features. The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed using various  
statistical techniques, which include exploratory analysis and correlation analysis. The exploratory analysis  
reviews the high prevalence of obesity risk associated with age and weight. The correlation analysis shows  
that the majority of features had a significant statistical relationship (p-value < 0.05). Physical activity of  
patients (FAF), SCC, Usage of technology (TUE), CAEC, and NCP all showed a weak negative and  
significant relationship with the obesity status of patients. A cost-sensitive weighing strategy was employed  
in this study to mitigate issues of class balancing of the target variable; this method enables higher weights  
to be assigned to minority classes. The proposed artificial neural network used in this study is made up of  
two hidden layers, and it was trained using the Adam optimizer over six distinct learning rates. The training  
results review that the ANN attained its optimal accuracy of 96.2% using a learning rate of 0.01, and it  
outperforms previous Machine learning algorithms used by previous studies in predicting obesity risk in  
patients. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ANNs in detecting obesity status and underscores  
their importance as decision-support tools for clinicians to enable early intervention and personalized  
treatment. Future research should consider incorporating broader socio-economic and lifestyle factors and  
larger real-world datasets to further enhance model generalizability and applicability in diverse healthcare  
settings.
